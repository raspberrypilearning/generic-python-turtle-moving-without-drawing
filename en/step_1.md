Sometimes you need to move a turtle around the screen without drawing. 

To lift the pen, use:

```python
turtle.penup()
```
Then you can use movement commands such as `forward`, `back`, and `goto` to move around the screen without drawing. 

To start drawing again, use:

```python
turtle.pendown()
```
